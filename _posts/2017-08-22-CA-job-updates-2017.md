I noted [a few posts ago](https://andyspecht.github.io/2017-07-30-Tech-Salary-Update-2017/) that the OES released their wage data for 2017. Since I have already detailed the queries I used to analyze this data in previous posts, I thought I would just do a quick post listing some interesting tidbits.

* The number of Information Security Analyst actually decreased in CA by 1.24% between 2016 and 2017. This is surprising, considering the widespread concern that there are not enough people working on IT security. [Here's an interesting take on the topic](http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cybersecuritys-ceiling-/d/d-id/1329600?piddl_msgid=329049#msg_329049).
* The occupation that increased the most between 2016 and 2017 was _Sociologist_ (77% - from 620 to 1100). Take that le STEM master race.
* On the other hand, Anthropologists and Archeologists decreased 25%.
* 8,390 technology jobs related to health were added in the last year. That's a big growth area.
