title: Why Do I Have A Blog?
---

It's 2017 and blogs aren't cool anymore. Why am I making one now? Here are some reasons:

* I want to have some sort of (professional) web presence.
* I can use Jekyll and learn more about git.
* It will encourage me to create a record of what I know, and I'll learn more when I take the time to carefully write it down.
* It will encourage me to seek out new topics and learn about them.
* I've learned a lot from the SQL Server community, and I'd like to contribute.
* The stuff that I'm interested in isn't always extensively covered by the really good SQL Server blogs. There's very detailed coverage of DBA topics (two great examples [here](https://www.brentozar.com/blog) and [here](https://www.littlekendra.com/)), but I'm interested in other topics as well.
* I also do Oracle database work, and there's not much out there to demystify Oracle. I'm going to be learning it better and hopefully what I write up will be helpful for others who haven't been using Oracle since the 80's.

That's it for now!
