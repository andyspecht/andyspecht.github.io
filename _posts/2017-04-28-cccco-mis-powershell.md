This is a quick post to highlight a very niche tool I made. You can see the full details [here](https://github.com/andyspecht/CA-MIS), but the short story is that I created a PowerShell script to automate part of the formatting required to submit data to the California Community College Chancellor's Office. So, if you happen to work at one of the ~130 institutions that has to do this, [check it out](https://github.com/andyspecht/CA-MIS)!
