- I'm Andy Specht.
- I live on the Central Coast of California and work as an IT director for a local college.
- I'm interested in all sorts of stuff, so I made this site to write about some of them. 
- Back in the day I completed a PhD in philosophy, and if you're interested in that, you can check out my [old, no-longer updated site](https://sites.google.com/site/spechtaf81/home).
- I like doing crosswords with my wife Adrienne.
